# rad_lifetime
This repository contains the source data and analysis scripts
for the manuscript "Non-monotonic size-dependent exciton radiative
lifetime in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals," Abbas and Chabeda et al.

Clone the git repository into a local directory, and run
the Jupyter notebook to generate all computational data files and figures.

The source code for computing eigenstates and correlated excitons in
the BSE framework can be obtained at: https://github.com/dchabeda/FilterBSE
